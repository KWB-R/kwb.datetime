\title{Convert Text Timestamps to POSIXct Objects}
\usage{
textToEuropeBerlinPosix(x, format = NULL, switches = TRUE,
  dbg = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{vector of text (i.e. character) timestamps}

\item{format}{format string describing the format of a timestamp, such as
"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S", see \code{\link{strftime}} for further percentage sign
placeholders. If not given or \code{NULL}, the function tries to guess the
format from the first timestamp given in \code{x}.}

\item{switches}{if \code{TRUE} (the default), the timestamps are assumed to
originate from a clock that switches between standard time and summer time.
Otherwise (\code{switches = FALSE}) timestamps are assumed to originate 
from a clock that stays in standard time over the whole year.}

\item{dbg}{if \code{TRUE} debug messages are shown}
}
\value{
vector of POSIXct objects
}
\description{
This function tries to overcome some problems that may arise when using
\code{\link{as.POSIXct}}. It can handle timestamps that originate from a 
clock that switches between standard time and summer time as well as those 
originating from a clock that stays in standard time over the whole year.  
See \code{vignette("text_to_posixct", package = "kwb.datetime")} for details.
It also tries to find a convenient format description string.

# Test the functions with the following "switch" days
